# Autonomous_land-mine_detection_robot_ROS
For my graduation project Autonomous landmine detection robot.
My team and I developed an autonomous land mine detection robot using ROS. 
Our robot successfully detected and marked the mines in the field using rviz. 
It also generated a map of the area using the gmapping package and data from the laser scan sensor. 
While we were able to implement the move_base package, we faced some issues while tuning its parameters. 2022
